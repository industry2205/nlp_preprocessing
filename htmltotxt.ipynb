      "\n",
      "citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Formwork comes in several types:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the earliest examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers\n",
      "\n",
      " Because concrete is quite strong in resisting compressive loads, but has relatively poor tensile or torsional strength, these early structures consisted of arches, vaults and domes\n",
      "\n",
      " The most notable concrete structure from this period is the Pantheon in Rome\n",
      "\n",
      " To mould this structure, temporary scaffolding and formwork or falsework was built in the future shape of the structure\n",
      "\n",
      " These building techniques were not isolated to pouring concrete, but were and are widely used in masonry\n",
      "\n",
      " Because of the complexity and the limited production capacity of the building material, concrete’s rise as a favored building material did not occur until the invention of Portland cement (and developments by the Edison Portland Cement Company) and reinforced concrete\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with engineered wood beams and supports are replaced with adjustable metal props\n",
      "\n",
      " This makes this method more systematic and reusable\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the dawn of the rival of concrete in slab structures, building techniques for the temporary structures were derived again from masonry and carpentry\n",
      "\n",
      " The traditional slab formwork technique consists of supports out of lumber or young tree trunks, that support rows of stringers assembled roughly 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres apart, depending on thickness of slab\n",
      "\n",
      " Between these stringers, joists are positioned roughly 12 inches, 30 centimeters apart upon which boards or plywood are placed\n",
      "\n",
      " The stringers and joists are usually 4 by 4 inch or 4 by 6 inch lumber\n",

      " The most common imperial plywood thickness is ¾ inch and the most common metric thickness is 18 mm\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with aluminium forming systems or steel beams and supports are replaced with metal props\n",
      "\n",
      " This also makes this method more systematic and reusable\n",
      "\n",
      "  Aluminum beams are fabricated as telescoping units which allows them to span supports that are located at varying distances apart\n",
      "\n",
      "  Telescoping aluminium beams can be used and reused in the construction of structures of varying size\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These systems consist of prefabricated timber, steel or aluminum beams and formwork modules\n",
      "\n",
      " Modules are often no larger than 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres in size\n",
      "\n",
      " The beams and formwork are typically set by hand and pinned, clipped, or screwed together\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These systems consist of slab formwork \"tables\" that are reused on multiple stories of a building without being dismantled\n",

      "\n",

      "A table is built pretty much the same way as a beam formwork but the single parts of this system are connected together in a way that makes them transportable\n",

      " The most common sheathing is plywood, but steel and fiberglass are also in use\n",
      "\n",
      " The joists are either made from timber, wood I-beams, aluminium or steel\n",
      "\n",
      " The stringers are sometimes made of wood I-beams but usually from steel channels\n",
      "\n",
      " These are fastened together (screwed, weld or bolted) to become a \"deck\"\n",
      "\n",
      " These decks are usually rectangular but can also be other shapes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All support systems have to be height adjustable to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured\n",
      "\n",
      " Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems\n",
      "\n",
      " Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses\n",
      "\n",
      " Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to\n",
      "\n",
      " Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns, thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether\n",
      "\n",
      "  In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors\n",

      " There are two general approaches in this system:\n",

      "This technique is fairly common in the United States and east Asian countries\n",
      "\n",
      " The advantages of this approach are the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique\n",

      " The disadvantages of this approach are the necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By this approach the tables are limited in size and weight\n",

      "7 and 6\n",
      "\n",
      "1 m), though table sizes may vary in size and form\n",
      "\n",
      " The major distinction of this approach is that the tables are lifted either with a crane transport fork or by material platform elevators attached to the side of the building\n",
      "\n",
      " They are usually transported horizontally to the elevator or crane lifting platform singlehandedly with shifting trolleys depending on their size and construction\n",
      "\n",
      "  Final positioning adjustments can be made by trolley\n",
      "\n",
      " This technique enjoys popularity in the US, Europe and generally in high labor cost countries\n",
      "\n",
      " The advantages of this approach in comparison to beam formwork or modular formwork is a further reduction of labor time and cost\n",
      "\n",
      " Smaller tables are generally easier to customize around geometrically complicated buildings, (round or non rectangular) or to form around columns in comparison to their large counterparts\n",

      "\n",
      "Geared traction machines are driven by AC or DC electric motors\n",
      "\n",
      " Geared machines use worm gears to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by \"rolling\" steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a gearbox driven by a high-speed motor\n",

      " These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to 3 m/s (500 ft/min)\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, AC motors were used for single or double-speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue\n",
      "\n",
      " Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution\n",
      "\n",
      " The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The widespread availability of variable frequency AC drives has allowed AC motors to be used universally, bringing with it the advantages of the older motor-generator, DC-based systems, without the penalties in terms of efficiency and complexity\n",
      "\n",
      " The older MG-based installations are gradually being replaced in older buildings due to their poor energy efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC\n",
      "\n",
      " In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor\n",
      "\n",
      " Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 20 m/s (4,000 ft/min), A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor\n",
      "\n",
      " This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering)\n",
      "\n",
      " But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab\n",
      "\n",
      " The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and is carried along a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa\n",

      " This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerised device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab\n",
      "\n",
      " The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40–50% of the capacity of the elevator\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Elevators with more than 30 m (98 ft) of travel have a system called compensation\n",

      " This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab\n",
      "\n",
      " This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab\n",
      "\n",
      " If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight\n",

      " If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another energy-saving improvement is the regenerative drive,4 which works analogously to regenerative braking in vehicles, using the elevator's electric motor as a generator to capture some of the gravitational potential energy of descent of a full cab (heavier than its counterweight) or ascent of an empty cab (lighter than its counterweight) and return it to the building's electrical system\n",

      " A diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\", if there's a sudden increase in pressure above the cab\n",

      " The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move\n",

      " The handle also served as a dead man switch: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop\n",

      "\n",
      " Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies\n",
      "\n",
      " This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate\n",

      " In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds\n",

      "3 Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current\n",
      "\n",
      " However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds\n",

      "Glasses and certain types of plastics are commonly welded materials\n",
      "\n",
      " Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition\n",
      "\n",
      " When heating the solid material past the glass-transition temperature (Tg) into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable\n",
      "\n",
      " When it crosses through the range, above the glass-melting temperature (Tm), it will become a very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid, slowly decreasing in viscosity as temperature increases\n",
      "\n",
      " Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension compared to metals, becoming a sticky, taffy to honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together\n",
      "\n",
      " The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact\n",
      "\n",
      " Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Glass welding is a common practice during glassblowing\n",
      "\n",
      " It is used very often in the construction of lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware\n",
      "\n",
      " It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars\n",
      "\n",
      " Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass\n",
      "\n",
      " Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high\n",
      "\n",
      " This temperature may vary, depending on the type of glass\n",
      "\n",
      " For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around 1,600 °F (870 °C), and can be welded with a simple propane torch\n",
      "\n",
      " On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over 3,000 °F (1,650 °C), but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used\n",
      "\n",
      " Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes\n",
      "\n",
      " When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily\n",
      "\n",
      " Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease\n",
      "\n",
      " However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself\n",

      " Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because glass is very brittle in its solid state, it is often prone to cracking upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven\n",
      "\n",
      " This is because the brittleness of glass does not allow for uneven thermal expansion\n",
      "\n",
      " Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types\n",
      "\n",
      " Different glasses often have different rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently\n",
      "\n",
      " For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion\n",
      "\n",
      " When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur\n",
      "\n",
      " Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Glass can also be welded to metals and ceramics, although with metals the process is usually more adhesion to the surface of the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials\n",
      "\n",
      " However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals\n",
      "\n",
      " For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum\n",
      "\n",
      " Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz\n",
      "\n",
      " However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again\n",
      "\n",
      " Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass\n",

      "Plastics are generally divided into two categories, which are \"thermosets\" and \"thermoplastics\n",

      "\" A thermoset is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic\n",
      "\n",
      " Thermosets cannot be melted, therefore, once a thermoset has set it is impossible to weld it\n",
      "\n",
      " Examples of thermosets include epoxies, silicone, vulcanized rubber, polyester, and polyurethane\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long molecular chains, which are often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order\n",
      "\n",
      " Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure\n",
      "\n",
      " Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition\n",
      "\n",
      " Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics)\n",

      "\n",
      "Welding thermoplastic is very similar to welding glass\n",
      "\n",
      " The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid\n",
      "\n",
      " Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one\n",
      "\n",
      " Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify\n",
      "\n",
      " A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints\n",
      "\n",
      " The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated\n",
      "\n",
      " Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it\n",
      "\n",
      " Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic\n",
      "\n",
      " Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods\n",
      "\n",
      " Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating\n",
      "\n",
      " Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "\n",
      "Many thermoplastics can also be welded using chemical solvents\n",
      "\n",
      " When placed in contact with the plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution\n",
      "\n",
      " When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one\n",
      "\n",
      " Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify\n",

      "Until the 1940s, plows and other tillage equipment usually were connected to the tractor via a drawbar\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The drawbar system necessitated the implement having its own running gear (usually wheels) and in the case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport\n",
      "\n",
      "  Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied\n",
      "\n",
      "2 The Fordson tractor (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was extremely prone to roll over backwards due to an excessively short wheelbase\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawbars were appropriate to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear\n",

      "Some tractor manufacturers produced matching equipment that could be directly mounted on the tractor\n",

      "\n",
      "  Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semi-permanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware\n",
      "\n",
      " Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis\n",
      "\n",
      "  As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations)\n",

      "\n",
      " If the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load could be doubled to 6,000 kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger mechanical advantage due to its larger diameter\n",

      "It is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured ratchets or brakes to forestall the load from running backward\n",

      "In 1845 a scheme was set in motion to provide piped water from distant reservoirs to the households of Newcastle\n",

      " However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this, because the foundations consisted of sand\n",
      "\n",
      " He eventually produced the hydraulic accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight\n",
      "\n",
      " The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure\n",
